## THE CAMPUSES
There are three campuses of PESU:
* The Hanumantha Nagar Campus (the HN campus)
* The Ring Road Campus (the RR campus)
* The Electronics City Campus (the EC campus)

Out of these, the HN campus is the oldest and the first ever campus of PES, the RR campus is the most developed, biggest and main campus, and the EC campus is rather spacious and peaceful, with a planned medical college and hospital.

## GENERAL STUFF
This is the most important section of this guide, so read each and every bit.

### RULES
* ID Card is a must, no matter what else you bring. This is to ensure security in the campus. Also, should you forget to bring your ID Card, but sometimes you can get away with showing your profile in the PESU App to gain entry to the campus.
* A minimum of 80 - 85% of attendance is necessary in every subject to be eligible to write the end-sems. Did I say every subject? Yes, attendance is taken subject-wise in universities, not day-wise. Please do remember that.

***

### CLASSES
Here's the timetable for majority of the days:
|      1      |       2      |     Break     |       3       |       4       |     Lunch     |       5       |       6       |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 8:15 - 9:15 | 9:15 - 10:15 | 10:15 - 10:45 | 10:45 - 11:45 | 11:45 - 12:45 | 12:45 - 13:30 | 13:30 - 14:30 | 14:30 - 15:30 |

In the first hour, there is a pardon of upto 10 minutes, which means you will be allowed into the class until 8:25, after which you might be allowed into the class but without attendance. No pardon for classes after breaks.

***

### STUFF YOU SHOULD HAVE
* A book for notes. A 5-subject spiral bound book is usually given by the university, so that's more than enough.
* Blue Book: A thin, 16-page book (with an obvious blue paper bind) used to write assessments and other lab exams. Costs around ₹10 - ₹12, so buy atleast 2 for each subject, and one more for safety.
*

### THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM
There are three types of examinations/tests held in PES:

#### Class Assignments / Lab assignments
Normal assignments of around 20 marks, conducted in the class and written in blue books. 1 assignment is conducted for every unit, and the aggregate marks are considered for the final score.

	There are no lab exams for Physics or Chemistry. Only for C and Python. There may, however, be a small 30 question lab quiz for Physics.

#### ISA (Internal Semester Assessment)
One of the most important assessments. Conducted in the assessment centre, it is a Computer-Based Test (CBT). 
* There is 1 ISA per unit, and is for 20 marks, for 30 minutes.
* The timetable will be sent a week before, and the seating allotment is shown in the app on the day of the respective exam.
* Majority of the questions are MCQs and some of them are descriptive, for which the answers should be typed in the PC.
* A rough sheet will be given for calculations.
* You can (usually) leave the exam centre as soon as you finish the exam.

#### ESA (End Semester Assessment)
* The final test of your bravery. It is a 100-mark examination for every subject.
* Written in the assessment centres, and seating allotment is given. Spans for 3 hours.
* Completely descriptive. You will be given an answer booklet for the exam. 
* The questions are displayed on the PC, and you can either write the answers in the booklet, or type the answers out in the provided fields.
* You can also use both methods for the same answer, such as typing the answer and drawing a necessary diagram.
* You can't leave the exam hall during the first 45 minutes and the last 10 minutes of the exam.

### THE PRN AND SRN
PRN (short for ) and SRN (short for ) are two unique IDs that are provided to you.
* The PRN format is `PESxyyyyzzzzz`, where `x` is your campus code (1 is RR, 2 is EC), `yyyy` is the year of admission, and `zzzzz` is a unique number. Examples: PES1202212345.
* The SRN format is `PESxzzyyccnnn`, where `x` is campus code, `zz` specifies your general qualification (UG for undergraduate), `yy` for year of admission, `cc` is course code (CS, EC, EE, AM, ME etc) and `nn` is a unique number. Example: PES2UG22EC123. \[ sorry if I doxxed someone :') \]

## THE FIRST YEAR
As long as you're in the first year, you are a part of the Science and Humanities (S&H) department. All students have to study a set of common subjects, irrespective of branch, for two semesters. 

***

### THE COURSE CONTENT
Students are divided into Physics and Chemistry cycles, usually based on alphabetical order of their names. But there are some common subjects in each semester irrespective of the cycle. If you get the Physics cycle in Sem 1, you'll get Chemistry cycle in Sem 2 and vice versa. The last alphabet is determined by the current sem. The first sem is 'A' and the second is 'B'.

#### Common Subjects
**FIRST SEMESTER**
* Python for Computational Problem Solving (UEyyCS151A)
* Engineering Mathematics - I (UEyyMA141A)

**SECOND SEMESTER**
* Problem Solving with C (UEyyCS151B)
* Engineering Mathematics - II (UEyyMA141B)

#### The Physics Cycle
* Engineering Physics (UEyyPH151x)
* Elements of Electrical Engineering (UEyyEE141x)
* Mechanical Engineering Sciences (UEyyME131x)
* Environmental Studies and Life Sciences (UEyyEV111x)

#### The Chemistry Cycle
* Engineering Chemistry (UEyyCY151x)
* Electronic Principles and Devices (UEyyEC141x)
* Engineering Statics - Mechanics (UEyyCV131x)
* Constitution Of India , Cyber Law and Professional Ethics (ULyyCE111x)
